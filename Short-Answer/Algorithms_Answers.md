## Exercise I

a) The function has a Big O notation of 0(n), the loop 3n times through each iteration. It is incremented 2n times.


b)  I believe this is O(n^2) because the of the loop that is nested within the outer for loop.

``` sum = 0
    for i in range(n): <-- O(n)
      j = 1
      while j < n: <-- O(n)
        j *= 2
        sum += 1
```


c) This function is recursive and that with each call it's linear because it's one call fore it's O(n)
